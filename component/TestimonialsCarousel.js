    text: 'Martin is a fantastic driving instructor! His attention to detail and calm approach assisted me greatly in obtaining my drivers licence. Martin is patient and gives easy to follow instructions, if I ever made a mistake he would explain to me exactly what I had done wrong, how it could potentially impact other road users, and how to fix it. I 100% would not have been able to obtain my drivers licence without Martin as my driving instructor. If you are looking for someone who is very knowledgeable, and will ensure that you have no bad driving habits come test day, look no further! Thanks again for all of your help Martin, I will really miss our lessons and chats - Shaye',
